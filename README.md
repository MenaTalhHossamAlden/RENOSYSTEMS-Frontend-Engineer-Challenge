# Requirements:
 - Implement attached screens as components using REACT.JS
 - Make sure to have the output UI matching the designs (the font and colors were not shared with me but it was a bonus if I could deliver it with the most matching look and feel)
 - Make sure that the functionality of creating/editing the users from the popup is working properly
 - Make Sure the search box on left side to be searching within the left component and filtering out the results instantly
 - Make sure the data not be hard coded and loaded dynamically in the components
