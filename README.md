# Requirements:

- Implement attached screens as components using REACT.JS
- Make sure to have the output UI matching the designs (the font and colors were not shared with me but it was a bonus if I could deliver it with the most matching look and feel)
- Make sure that the functionality of creating/editing the users from the popup is working properly
- Make Sure the search box on left side to be searching within the left component and filtering out the results instantly
- Make sure the data not be hard coded and loaded dynamically in the components

# Deadline :

- 2 days
